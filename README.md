# Space-Invaders-Game
Final project for my C++ class

The project was done together with ulbas.

The prosjekt was built using Windows Visual Studios 2015. Most of the graphics are original, the explosion sprite was found using google.
The sound files are from freesound and other sound design libraries, which we do not own.
